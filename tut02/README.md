# Series - Make the Leap from Javascript to PureScript Series (DRAFT)

## Tutorial 2 - Refactor imperative code to a single composed expression using Box

This is the first tutorial in the series **Make the leap from JavaScript to PureScript**.  First, be sure to read the series [Introduction](https://github.com/adkelley/javascript-to-purescript), where the goals & outline, and the installation, compilation, & running of PureScript are covered.

The series outline and javascript code samples have been borrowed with permission from the egghead.io course [Professor Frisby Introduces Composable Functional JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript) by
[Brian Lonsdorf](https://github.com/DrBoolean) - thank you Brian! A fundamental assumption of each tutorial is that you've watched his video already before tackling the abstraction in PureScript.  Brian covers the featured abstraction extremely well, and I feel its better to understand its implementation in the comfort of your own familiar JavaScript.  For this tutorial, the abstraction is Box( ) covered in [video1](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-linear-data-flow-with-container-style-types-box). Note that the Box( ) abstraction is better known as the 'Identity' functor in swanky FP circles.  

So one more time with feeling - You should already somewhat familiar with the **Box** abstraction. You're also able to enter `bower update && pulp run` and `pulp run` thereafter, to load the library dependencies, compile the program, and run the PureScript code example.  **Finally**, if you read something that you feel could be explained better, or a code example that should be refactored then please let me know via a comment or pull request on github. Let's go!

You may find that the README for the next tutorial is under construction. But if you're an eager beaver and would like to look ahead, then all the of code samples from Brian's [videos](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript) have been ported to PureScript already. But I may amend them as I write the accompanying tutorial markdown.
