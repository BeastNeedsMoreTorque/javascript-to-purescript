Welcome to Tutorial 11 in the series **Make the leap from Javascript to PureScript** and I hope you're enjoying it thus far.  In this tutorial, we are going to cover Lazy evaluation, which is a technique for keeping your code pure, by deferring evaluation along with any side effects until it's time to return a value.  Lazy evaluation has a few more benefits as we'll see shortly.  And, as promised in my last tutorial, I'm going to cover testing in PureScript.  While PureScript may eliminate the need to test for simple errors, like any other programming language, testing is something you should not neglect to carry out.

Be sure to read the series [Introduction](https://github.com/adkelley/javascript-to-purescript) to learn how to install and run PureScript. I borrowed (with permission) the outline and javascript code samples from the egghead.io course [Professor Frisby Introduces Composable Functional JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript) by
[Brian Lonsdorf](https://github.com/DrBoolean) - thank you, Brian! A fundamental assumption is that you have watched his [video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-unboxing-things-with-foldable) before tackling the equivalent PureScript abstraction featured in this tutorial.  Brian covers the featured concepts exceptionally well, and it's better you understand its implementation in the comfort of JavaScript.

You will find the markdown and all code examples for this tutorial on [Github](https://github.com/adkelley/javascript-to-purescript/tree/master/tut11).  If you read something that you feel could be explained better, or a code example that needs refactoring, then please let me know via a comment or send me a [pull request](https://github.com/adkelley/javascript-to-purescript/tree/master/tut11).

## Lazy evaluation
Lazy evaluation, also known as "call by need," is a program execution strategy that defers the computation of expressions in your program until you need them.  Also, once you evaluate an expression, the result is often "memoized" to ensure that it is computed only once.  Meaning, if the value is required again later in your program then, instead of re-evaluating the expression, the runtime will access the stored result from cache.

As you might imagine, this approach can reduce the running time of a function because it avoids repeated evaluations of the same result.  Another advantage is that you can take data structures, such as an array, and express their range as infinite.  Then, generate as many items as you need from that data structure without apriori knowledge of its size.

The opposite approach is called `strict evaluation`, also known as `call by value` or `eager evaluation`.  Let's look at strict evaluation using a trivial example in JavaScript.    Recognize that `f` disregards the argument `y` in this function.

```javascript
const f = (x, y)  => {
   return  2 * x
}

> f(5, 2 + 3)
< 10
```
Javascript uses strict evaluation and therefore will waste some amount of CPU cycles (albeit small in this example) on evaluating and binding `2 + 3` to `y` before calling `f`.  But in languages such as Haskell that are "lazy" by default, their compilers are often smart enough to recognize that `f` doesn't need `y` to return its result, and therefore will avoid this computation.  

### PureScript is "eager" to please
PureScript takes on the default characteristics of its target output language (i.e., JavaScript) by employing strict evaluation.  Now donâ€™t take my word for it, let's look at the transcompiled code from the following PureScript code example.  You should again notice that `f` does not use the argument `y` in the computation.  

```haskell
f :: Int -> Int -> Int
f x y = 2 * x

main = 
   logShow $ f 5 (2 + 3) 
```
Transcompiled to JavaScript:
```javascript
var f = function (x) {
    return function (y) {
        return 2 * x | 0;
    };
};

var main =
  Control_Monad_Eff_Console.logShow(Data_Show.showInt)(f(5)(2 + 3 | 0));
```

As shown, despite never using `y` in the function computation, `main` will still evaluate `2 + 3` before calling `f`.  However, this should not be setting off alarm bells in your head.  In fact, nearly all programming languages are strict, with one notable exception being Haskell.  There are some advantages because optimization for strict languages is common amongst modern hardware architectures.  Even the best compilers for lazy languages will likely produce slower code.  In strict programming languages, the developer gets to decide about the order of execution of your program.  But this is somewhat of a grey area because modern compilers will naturally look for efficiencies, including reordering of expressions to best optimize processor resources.  

There are a few more details in the transcompiled code example that deserve a further explanation; namely the bitwise OR operation (e.g., `return 2 * x | 0`)  and currying.  First I'll cover the purpose of performing the Bitwise OR operation,  then I'll talk a little about currying, saving the bulk of this subject for Tutorial 17. 

### Ensuring that an Int is an Int
Notice in the PureScript code above, that the two arguments `x` and `y` to the function `f` are of type `Int`, and that `f` will also return a value of type `Int`.  By performing a bitwise OR operation on the input argument `y` (i.e., `2 + 3 | 0`), the PureScript compiler provides a guarantee within the transpiled JavaScript code that the resulting type will be a 32-bit signed integer `Int`.  For example:
```javascript
var x = 113.45 | 0;   // becomes 113
var y = 11.12  | 0;     // becomes 11
```
Analogously, by performing a bitwise OR operation on the return value from the function `f` (i.e., `2 * x | 0`), PureScript ensures that this value will be `Int`, as well.  

### Currying
The second topic of interest from the transcompiled code above is currying.  Again, we'll save this subject for Tutorial 17 but, in short, when there are multiple arguments to a function, PureScript will transcompile it to JavaScript as a sequence of nested functions. Each will take one argument and return the next function or, in the case of the last one, give back the final result.  This nesting of functions is called `currying`, and it is a cornerstone of functional programming.

## Lazy Box example
Now that we've covered the difference between "lazy" and "strict" evaluation let's move on to the main code example that demonstrates how to transform the computation of a data structure from eager to lazy.  From Brian's [video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-delaying-evaluation-with-lazybox) you saw how to take our original `Box` type from [Tutorial 1](https://github.com/adkelley/javascript-to-purescript/blob/master/tut01/README.md), and make it "lazy" with just a few modifications:
```javascript
const LazyBox = g =>
({
   fold:   f => f(g()),
   map:  f => LazyBox(() => f(g(())))
   inspect: () =>  `LazyBox(${g()})`
})

const result = LazyBox(() =>  '     64    ')
                         .map(abba => abba.trim())
                         .map(trimmed => new Number(trimmed))
                         .map(number => number + 1)
                         .map(x => String.fromCharCode(x))
                         .fold(x => x.toLowerCase())
```

So, how is this accomplished in PureScript?  Well, when it comes to lazy evaluation, there is no need to define it ourselves.  Instead, there is the `Lazy` class, which represents types that allow the evaluation of values to be deferred.  Moreover, its comes chalk full of instances besides `map`.  So we can quickly port `LazyBox` to `Lazy` in PureScript with the following code example:
```haskell
import Data.Lazy (Lazy, defer, force)

nextCharForNumberString :: String -> Lazy String
nextCharForNumberString str = do
  defer (\_ -> str) #
  map trim #
  map (\s -> fromMaybe 0 $ fromString s) #
  map (_ + 1) #
  map (\i -> fromCharCode i) #
  map (\c -> toLower $ unsafeCoerce c :: String)

main = do
  let lazyVal= nextCharForNumberString "     64   "
  logShow lazyVal
  log $ force lazyVal -- a
```
Besides the `Lazy` class, the two functions you should understand are `defer` and `force`.  The `defer` function does what you expect.  Just like our JavaScript example, it creates a Lazy value by assigning the concrete type `a` to an anonymous function.  The type signature for `defer` is
```haskell
defer :: forall a. (Unit -> a)  -> Lazy a
``` 
Brian's mentions in his tutorial that this gives us "purity by virtue of laziness," because you'll never observe the effects by using `map` or any other instance belonging to the `Lazy` class until we apply `force`.  This delay in the evaluation of an expression is known as a `thunk`, a word that you'll often hear in functional programming.  The `force` function` has the type signature:
has the type signature:
```haskell
force :: forall a. Lazy a -> a
and it is analogous to `fold` in the JavaScript example because it "forces" the evaluation of all of the expressions recorded in `lazyVal` from `nextCharForNumberString`.  
```

### Practical uses for Lazy
By far, the canonical example of lazy evaluation is working with infinite lists or arrays.  For example, it's nice that I can start creating a list or array of numbers, then take only the ones I need without worrying whether I generated too many or too little.  But, as you'll see below, it's not as concise to do this in PureScript as it is in Haskell, where list or array generation is lazy by default.  But alas it is possible!

The last time I encountered the need for `Lazy` was, of all things, solving [Problem 2](https://projecteuler.net/problem=2) in the Euler Project Series. It asks you to find the sum of even numbers in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million.  With Haskell being lazy, I was amazed at how easily I was able to solve this using `takeWhile`.
```haskell
module Problem2 (solution) where

lazyFibSeq :: Integer -> Integer -> [Integer]
lazyFibSeq f1 f2 = f1 : lazyFibSeq f2 (f1 + f2)

solution :: Integer -> Integer
solution maxFib = sum $ filter even $ takeWhile (< maxFib) $ lazyFibSeq 1 2
```
Could I use the same code in PureScript? Well, sort of . . .

```haskell
module Problem2
  (solution
    ) where

import Prelude
import Data.Foldable (sum)
import Data.Int (even)
import Data.Lazy (Lazy, defer)
import Data.List.Lazy (List(List), Step(Cons), takeWhile, filter)

lazyCons :: forall a. a -> Lazy (List a) -> List a
lazyCons a b = List (map (Cons a) b)

lazyFibList :: Int -> Int -> List Int
lazyFibList f1 f2 = lazyCons f1 (defer \_ -> lazyFibList f2 (f1 + f2))

solution :: Int -> Int
solution maxFib = sum $ filter even $ takeWhile (_ < maxFib) (lazyFibList 1 2)

main = do
     log $ "Problem 2: " <> show (solution 4000000)
```

Nope, this is not as concise as my solution in Haskell.  Because PureScript is a strict language by default, I had to be more explicit using `defer` to tell PureScript that I wanted to lazily `cons` a list of Fibonacci numbers together.  If you're interested in looking at my solutions (1-8 so far) to the `Project Euler` problems you will find them on [github](https://github.com/adkelley/project-euler-purescript.git).  It's also an excellent example of how to create a test-suite in PureScript. 

## I should write about writing tests!
Oh, those dreaded tests.  Perhaps you thought you could avoid them because you heard that, similar to Haskell, "If a PureScript program compiles, then it probably works." Well, I experience this regularly, and it's a great feeling.  So yes - working in a strongly typed functional programming language mitigates writing tests for simple errors.  But it wonâ€™t help you to expose problems in your program's design or logic.  So you will still be required to write tests in PureScript.  But hopefully, you'll enjoy writing them because you're testing for things that genuinely matter, instead of trivial things you can't avoid testing for when using JavaScript.

### There's more on this topic to come
In my last blog post, I mentioned that I would include a section on testing in this blog post.  What I didn't realize is that this topic deserves an entire blog post of its own.  So that got me to thinking - there are many things about PureScript that I am interested in writing, but they donâ€™t follow the outline of my "Make the Leap . . ." series.  Therefore, I am going to create individual blog posts about testing other topics while "sticking to the script" for this series.   Stay tuned.

## Summary
In this blog post, we looked at lazy evaluation and found that both JavaScript and PureScript use strict or eager evaluation by default.  But, with a little help from `defer` and `force`, we can evaluate expressions lazily in PureScript and even memoize them to avoid recalculation.  This delay in the evaluation of an expression is known as a `thunk`, a word that you'll often hear in functional programming.

We also solved the mystery of how the PureScript compiler ensures `Int` type signatures on arguments. It uses a bitwise OR operation before passing or returning values to and from a function.  Looking at this transpiled code example forced us to delve into the concept of currying.  It is how PureScript turns multiple arguments to a function into a sequence of nested functions when transcompiling to JavaScript.  Currying is a cornerstone of functional programming, so be sure that you understand it.  As an aside, in most cases, you will find PureScript's transcompiled JavaScript code to be quite readable.  Therefore, I would encourage you to look under the covers to see how PureScript handles type-classes & instances, and other aspects you may be interested in knowing.

Finally, we learned that the two primary use cases for lazy evaluation are enforcing purity by delaying impure side effects and working with infinite lists or arrays.  You can generate data structures without knowing in advance as to how small or large they need to be.  We saw how that works in the Fibonacci sequence example, for solving Problem 2 from Project Euler.
