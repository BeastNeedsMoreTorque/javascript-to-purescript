Welcome to Tutorial 6 in the series **Make the leap from Javascript to PureScript**.  I hope you've enjoyed the learnings thus far.  Be sure to read the series [Introduction](https://github.com/adkelley/javascript-to-purescript) to learn how to install and run PureScript. I borrowed (with permission) this series outline and javascript code samples from the egghead.io course [Professor Frisby Introduces Composable Functional JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript) by
[Brian Lonsdorf](https://github.com/DrBoolean) - thank you, Brian! A fundamental assumption is that you have watched his [video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-composable-error-handling-with-either) before tackling the equivalent PureScript abstraction featured in this tutorial.  Brian covers the featured concepts extremely well, and it's better that you understand its implementation in the comfort of JavaScript.

If you read something that you feel could be explained better, or a code example that needs refactoring, then please let me know via a comment or send me a pull request on [Github](https://github.com/adkelley/javascript-to-purescript/tree/master/tut05).  Finally, If you are enjoying this series then please help me to tell others by recommending this article and/or favoring it on social media

You may find that the README for the next tutorial is under construction. But if you're an eager beaver and would like to look ahead, then all the of code samples from Brian's [videos](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript) have been ported to PureScript already. But I may amend them as I write the accompanying tutorial markdown.
