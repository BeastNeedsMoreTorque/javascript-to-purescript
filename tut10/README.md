Welcome to Tutorial 10 in the series **Make the leap from Javascript to PureScript** and I hope you're enjoying it thus far.  In this tutorial, we're going to break the topic of monoids wide open by increasing our vocabulary and showing how to put them to good use in production.  Be sure to read the series [Introduction](https://github.com/adkelley/javascript-to-purescript) to learn how to install and run PureScript. I borrowed (with permission) the outline and javascript code samples from the egghead.io course [Professor Frisby Introduces Composable Functional JavaScript](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript) by
[Brian Lonsdorf](https://github.com/DrBoolean) - thank you, Brian! A fundamental assumption is that you have watched his [video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-a-curated-collection-of-monoids-and-their-uses) before tackling the equivalent PureScript abstraction featured in this tutorial.  Brian covers the featured concepts extremely well, and it's better you understand its implementation in the comfort of JavaScript.

You will find the markdown and all code examples for this tutorial on [Github](https://github.com/adkelley/javascript-to-purescript/tree/master/tut10).  If you read something that you feel could be explained better, or a code example that needs refactoring, then please let me know via a comment or send me a [pull request](https://github.com/adkelley/javascript-to-purescript/tree/master/tut10).  Finally, If you are enjoying this series, then please help me to tell others by recommending this article and favoring it on social media.

## Review foldMap
## Additional monoids
Dual, Last, Ordering, etc.
## Ablien monoid
Abelian monoid is a monoid that is also commutative, like addition and multiplication (but not lists or strings, for which order is significant). You can also just say commutative monoid or, if you prefer, not talk about them at all. But do spread the word about monoids.

You may find that the README for the next tutorial is under construction. But if you're an eager beaver and would like to look ahead, then all the of code samples from Brian's [videos](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript) have been ported to PureScript already. But I may amend them as I write the accompanying tutorial markdown.
