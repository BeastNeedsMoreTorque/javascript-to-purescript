# Make the Leap from Javascript to PureScript - Tutorial 1 (DRAFT)

## Create linear data flow with container style types (Box)

This is the first tutorial in the series **Make the leap from Javascript to PureScript**.  Be sure to read the series [Introduction](http://github/adkelley/javascript-to-purescript/README.md) where you'll find the Javascript reference for learning FP abstractions, but also how to install and run PureScript. The series outline and javascript code samples have been borrowed from the egghead.io course [Professor Frisby Introduces Composable Functional Javascript](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript) by
[Brian Lonsdorf](https://github.com/DrBoolean). I assume that you've watched Brian's [video](https://egghead.io/lessons/javascript-linear-data-flow-with-container-style-types-box) and PureScript, together with Bower and Pulp have been installed.  That is you're familiar with the **Box** abstraction you're able to enter `bower update && pulp run` to load the library dependencies, compile the program, and run the code.  Let's go!

You may find that the README for the next tutorial is under construction. But if you're an eager beaver and would like to look ahead, then all the of code samples from Brian's [videos](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript) have been ported to PureScript already. But I may amend them as I write the accompanying tutorial markdown.
